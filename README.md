# Custom-Editor-Extension-Documentation (CEED)
A tool that show most (if not all) objects you can create to your editor in Unity

## How to install
If you wish to install this tool quickly use "Quick install". This is just one cs file that must be put in the editor folder. If you do not have an editor folder yet, create one wherever you please in the project.

## How to use
This tool is made primarly to speed up the custom editor workflow by geting a look how the items will look like and copiying the base code. Some items like Icons might need to be cased/converted as image to work with most items. Any documentation can be found either on the item themselves or by pressing the title of each category.

You can play around with each item to see how they work, when you've found a item you'd like you can press the "Copy Template" option and it will copy the code that is used to display. Of course, without overload variables, although helper comments are added to each item to help you adapt it into your own custom editor.

If you want to add your own items you can do so, but I recommed using the "Open Source" option due to it splitting up the collection of Unity's documentation and overall text that is used for the tool.

Hope this will help you out!
